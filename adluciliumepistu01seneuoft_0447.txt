Α. ey are of so little account that they fail to console
-.· for the loss of one. If, on the other hand, we
ᾗ ve no other friends, we have injured ourselves
. · ore than Fortune has injured us; since F ortune has
ζ] bbed us of one friend, but we have robbed ourselves
ζ every friend whom we have failed to make.
¹, ;:·, he who has been unable to love more than
J e, has had none too much love even for that 0116.ω
Α a man who has lost his one and only tunic through
bbery chooses to bewail his plight rather than

ι ⁴ sible man, is to grow weary of sorrowing. I

' · as possible, since, even if you wish to do so, it is
, · ο .- ‘ble to keep it up for a long time. Our fore-

ι should be the limit for mourning3 not that they
, --ed to mourn for so long, but that they should
' · rn no longer. In the case of men, no rules are
,ι · down, because to mourn at all is not regarded as
Ϊρ ourable. For all that, what woman can you show
’ , os all the pathetic females that could scarcely be
ged away from the funeral-pile or torn from the
·-: , whose tears have lasted a whole month?
