or do you think that we should avoid including,

’ among the causes of a thing which has been made,

} that clement without which the thing in question f> (417
ἦ would not have been made?

’ς To these four Plato adds a fisth cause,—thel12‹⁴⁴4
ffissssfflffffisshamhitffimff {³¹¹2 ἓῖἳιζὲζᾶὲἶζὲεἷὲζέἱιῖἓ “⁸⁴²⁴
{work which he 1]ωὲῃέἓοίᾶὲ to carry out. Now it ‘fau
· makes no difference whether he has his pattern &Aah
‚ outside himself, that he may direct his glance to it, ev(

ἱ οι· within himself, conceived and placed there by ' ω
himself. [God has within himself these patterns of

’ all things, and his mind comprehends the harmonie

, and the measures of the whole totality of tHin 50ss
ξ’ which are to be carried out3 he is filled with these A

τ shapes which Plato calls the “ ideas‚”—imperishable,

³ unchangeable, not subject to decay. And therefore, &fest
l though men die, humanity itself, or he idea of man, ‹0ss
according to which man is moulded, lasts on, and]
though men toil and perish, it suffers no changes α’
Accordingly, there are five causes, as Plato saysb:
; the material, the agent, the make-up, the model, and
the end in view. Last comes the result of all these.
3 - ust as in the case of the statue,—-to go back to
j he figure with which we began,—the material is the
ἕ bronze, the agent is the artist, the make-up is the
l orm which is adapted to the material, the model is
be pattern imitated by the agent, the end in view
2—: the purpose in the maker’s mind, and, finally, the
·- lt of all these is the statue itself. The universe
2 so, in l'lato’s opinion, possesses all these elements.
'i he agent is G0d; the source, matter; the form, the
g hape and the arrangement of the visible world.
⁴ e pattern is doubtless the model according to

hich God has made this great and most beautiful
