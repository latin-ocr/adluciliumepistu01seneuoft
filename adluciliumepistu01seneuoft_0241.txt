EPISTLE XXX.

pleasure3 he was casting his vote concerning death
and pointing out what sort of a thing it is when
it is observed, so to speak, nearer at- hand. 1

you, if he had come back to life and should declare
from experience that there is no evil in death; and
so, regarding the approach of death, those will tell
you best what disquiet it brings who have stood
in its path, who have seen it coming and have
welcomed it. Bassus may be included among these
men3 and he had no wish to deceive us. He says

age; for death follows old age precisely as old age
follows youth. He who does not wish to die cannot
have wished to live. For life is granted to us with
the roeewation that we shall die; to· this end our
path lcads. Therefore, how foolish it is to fear it,
since men simply await that which is sure, but sear
only that which is uncertain! Death has its fixed
rule,—equitable and unavoidable. Who can com-
plain when he is governed by terms which include
everyone? The chief part of equity, however, is
’ nali .

‘eq Bul:y it is superfluous at the present time to
plead Nature's cause; for she wishes our laws to be
identical with her own3 she but resolves that which
’ she has compounded, and compounds again that
; which she has resolved. Moreover, if it falls to the
lot of any man to be set gently adrift by old age,
—not suddenly torn from life, but withdrawn bit
by bit,—oh, verily he should thank the godS, one
and all, because, after he has had his fill, he is
Α removed to a rest which is ordained for mankind, a
ἶν’ rest that is welcome to the weary. You may observe

that it is as foolish to fear death as to fear old ’
