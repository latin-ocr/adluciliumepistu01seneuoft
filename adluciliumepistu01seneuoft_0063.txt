EPISTLE VIII.

1 point other men to the right path, which Ι have

found late in life, when wearied with wandering. Ι cry
out to them: “ Avoid whatever pleases the throng:
avoid the gifts of Chance! Halt before every good
which Chance brings to you, in a spirit of doubt and
sear; for it is the dumb animals and fish that are de-
ceived by tempting hopes. Do you call these things
the ‘ gists ’ of Fortune ? They are snares. And any

when she begins to drive us to leeward; nor can we
go down, either, ‘with the ship at least on her
course,¹ or once for all‘²; Fortune does not capsize

by a roos of gold. Despise everything that useless
tou erentes as an ornament and an object of bcauty.
And reflect that nothing except the soul is worthy
