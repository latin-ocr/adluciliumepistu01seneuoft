Α world of things, from which they have come forth
and are soon to come forth again, is annihilated3
they merely end their course and do not perish.
And death, which we sear and shrink from, merely
interrupts life, but does not steal it away3 the time
will return when we shall be restored to the light
of day; and many men would object bo this, were
they not brought back in forgetfulness of the past.
But I mean to show you later? with more
care, that every-thing which seems to perish merely
changes. Since you are destined to return, you ought
to depart with a tranquil mind. Mark how the
round of the universe repeats its course3 you will see
ι that no star in our firmamentis extinguished, but that
they all set and rise in alternation. Summer has
gone, but another year will bring it again3 winter
lies low, but will be restored by its own proper months3
night has overwhelmed the sun, but day will soon
rout the night again. The wandering stars retrace
their former cour-8683 a part of the sky is rising un-
2 ceasingly‚ and a part is sinking. One word more,
¹ and then 1 shall stop; infants, and boys, and those
who have gone mad, have no sear of death, and it
'ss most shamesul if reason cannot afford us that
&fesci-l ming to wlssch they have been brought by
eir o y. arewe .

XXXVII. ΟΝ ALLEGIANCE To VIRTUE

You have promised to be a good man3 you have-
¹culisted under oath3 that is the strongest chain
which will hold you to a sound understanding.
Any man will be but mocking you, if he declares that
this is an effeminate and easy kind of soldiering. 1
