EPISTLES ΙΙΙ., IV.

There is a class of men who communicate, to any-
ne whom they meet, matters which should be re-
vealed to friends alone, and unload upon the chance
listener whatever irks them. Others, again, fear to
confide in their closest iutimates; and if it were
possible, they would not trust even themselves, bury-
ing their secrets deep in their hearts. But we should
do neither. It is equally faulty to trust every one and
ω trust no one. Yet the former fault is, I should
say, the more ingenuouS, the latter the more safe.
In like manner you should rebuke these two kinds
of men, —both those who always lack repose, and those
who are always m repose. For love of bustle is not
industn, —it is only the restlessness of a hunted ’
’ ind. And true repose does not consist in con-
emning all motion as merely vexati0n3 that kind

reading in Pomponiusa : “ Some men shrink into dark
corners, to such a degree that they see darkly by
day.” No, men should combine these tendencies,
and he who reposes should act and he who acts
should take repose. Discuss the problem with
Nature; she will tell you that she has created both
day and night. Farewell.
