j one of us goes deep below the surface. We skim
e top only, and we regard the smattering of time
ξ, · -nt in the search for wisdom as enough and to
l: · re for a busy man. What hinders us most of all
κ that we are too readily satisfled with ourselves;
if we meet with sorneone who calls us good men,
·r sensible men, or holy men, we see ourselves in his
’νεεοτίρῑίοα Not content with praise in moderation,
”-· e accept everything that shameless flattery heaps
pon us, as if it were our due. W e agree with those
ζ ho declare us to be the best and wisest of men,
ἰ though we know that they are given to much
⁵ ,8. And we are so sels-complacent that we desire

v . e for certain actions when we are especially

ο · cted to the very opposite. Yonder person hears

ἰι ·lf called‘ ‘most gentle” when he is inflicting
·s, or “most generous '’ when he is engaged in
uting, or “most temperate '' when he is in the
'··‘dst of drunkenness and lust. Thus it follows
ost we are unwilling to be reformed, just because
e believe ourselves to be the best of men.

    
     
    
   
    
     
   
   
    
    
   

Alexander was roaming as far as India, ravaging
Α ’bes that were but little known, even to their
ighbours. During the blockade of a certain city,
,hile he was reconnoitring the walls and hunting
·¹ the weakest spot in the fortifications‚ he was
·unded by an arrow. Nevertheless, he long con-
* ·ued the siege, intent on finishing what he had
«g n. The pain of his wound, however, as the
&face became dry and as the flow of blood was
·ecked, increased3 his leg gradually became numb
he sat his horse; and finally, when he was forced
· withdraw, he exclaimed: “ All men swear that Ι
·· the son of Jupiter, but this wound eries out that
'1 am mortal.''⁰ Let us also act in the same way.
