EPISTLE XVII.

ι’ retort: “l wish to acquire something to live on.”
Yes, but learn while you are acquiring it; for if any-
thing forbids you to live nobly, nothing forbids you to
die nobly. There is no reason why poverty should
call us away from philosophy,—no, nor even actual
want. For when hastening after wisdom, we must
endure even hunger. Men have endured hunger
when their towns were besieged, and what other
reward for their endurance did they obtain than
that they did not fall under the conqueror's power?
How much greater is the promise of the prize
of everlasting liberty, and the assuranee that we
need sear neither God nor man! Even though
we starve, we must reach that goal. Armies have
endured all manner of want, have lived on roots,
and have resisted hunger by means of food too re-
volting to mention. All this they have suffered to
gain a kingdom, and,—what is more marvellous,—
to gain a kingdom that will be another's. Will any
man hesitate to endure poverty, in order that he
may free his mind from madness?
