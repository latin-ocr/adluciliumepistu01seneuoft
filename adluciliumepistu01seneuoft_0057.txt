8 murderer, he deserved this punishment, what crime
bave you committed, poor fellow, that you should
desei-ve to sit and see this show? In the morning
they cried “Kill him! Lash him! Burn him!
Why does he meet the sword in so cowardly a way ?
Why does he strike so feebly? Why doesn’t he die
game? Whip him to meet his wounds! Let them
receive blow for blow, with chests bare and exposed χ
to the stroke!” And when the games stop for ,
the intermission, they announce: “A little throat-
cutting in the meantime, so that there may still be
mething going on! ” ο
Come now3 do youa not understand even this
th, that a bad example reacts on the agent?
ank the immortal gods that you are teaching
cruelty to 8 person who cannot leam to be cruel.
The young character, which cannot hold fast to
n‘ghteousneSS, must be rescued from the mob3 it is
bo easy to side with the majority. Evcn SocrateET'
Cato, and Laelius might have been shaken in their
moral strength by a crowd that was unlike them; so ivs»
five it is that none of us, no matter how much he
cultivates his abilitieS, can withstand the shock of
finlts that approach, as it were, with so great a
winae. Much barm is done by 8 ‘single case of
ulgence or greed; the familiar friend, if he be
. urions, weakens and softens us imperceptibly; the
neighbour, if he be rich, rouses our covetousness3 the
ωωραῐιὶοη, if he slanderous, rubs off some of his
rust upon us, even bbugh we be spotless and sincere.
what then do you think the effect will be on char· Η
aeter, when the world at large assaults it! You
must either imitate or loathe the world. “·'
