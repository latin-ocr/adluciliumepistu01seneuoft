EPISTLES xxxvn„ XXXVIII.

You will learn from her what you should undertake,
and how it should be done ; you will not blunder
into things, You can show me no man who knows
how he began to crave that which he craveS. He
has not been led to that pass by forethought3 he
has been driven to it by impulse. Fortune attacks
us as osten as we attack Fortune. It is disgracesul,
instead of proceeding ahead, to be carried along,
and then suddenly, amid the whirlpool of events, to
ask in a dazed way: “How did I get into this
condition?’' Farewell.

    
   
    
  
   
    
    
      
    

XXXVIII. ΟΝ QUIET CONVERSATION

You are right when you urge that we increase our
mutual traffic in letters. But the greatest beneflt
is to be derived from conversation, because it creeps
by degrees into the soul. Lectures prepared before-
hand and spouted in the presence of a throng have
ln them more noise but less intimacy. Philosophy
h good advice; and no one can give advice at the
hp of his lungs. Of course we must sometimes also
make use of these hai-angues, if Ι may so call them,
‘when a doubting member needs to be spurred on;
but when the aim is to make a man learn, and not
merely to make him wish to learn, we must have
rse to the low-toned words of conversation.
'ssiey enter more easily, and stick in the memory ;
fu· we do not need many words», but, rather, effective

Words should be scattered like seed3 no matter
small the seed may be, if it has once found
favans-able ground, it unfolds its strength and from
ιιι insignificant thing spreads to its greatest growth.
