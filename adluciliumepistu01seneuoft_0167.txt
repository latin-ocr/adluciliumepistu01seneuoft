EPISTLE XXI.

these tw0 lives as there is between mere brightness
and real light3 the latter has a definite source
within itself, the other borrows its radiance3 the
one is called forth by an illumination coming

from the outside, and anyone who stands between '

the source and the object immediately turns the
Ι latter into a dense shadow; but the other has a

glow that comes from within.
y It is your own studies that will make you shine
ι and will render you eminent. Allow me to mention
the case of Epicurus. He was writing ⁰ to Idomeneus
and trying to recall him from a showy existence to
sure and steadfast renown. Idomeneus was at that

    
    
   
    
   
    

time a minister of state who exercised a rigorous
authority and had important affairs in hand. “ If,”
naid Epicurus, “ you are attracted by fame, my
letters will make you more renowned than all the

things which you cherish and which make you
eherished.” Did ‘Epicurus speak falsely? Who
would have known of Idomeneus, had not the philo-
tophet thus engraved his name in those letters of
Ξ· Au the grandees and satraps, even the king
k sels, who was petitioned for the title which
meneus sought, are sunk in deep oblivion.
‚ ro’s letters keep the name of Atticus from
εει-ιεὴίιις. lt would have profited Atticus nothing
have an Agrippa for a son-in-law, a Tiberius for
e husband of his grand-daughter, and a Drusus
for a great-grandson; amid these mighty
his name would never be spoken, had not
ro bound him to himself! The deep flood of
e will roll over us3 some few great men will raise
heads above it, and, though destined at the last
depart into the same realms of silence, will battle
⁸ oblivion and maintain their ground for long
