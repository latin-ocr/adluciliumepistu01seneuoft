EPISTLE LIII.

1 was suffering too grievously to think of the danger,
'since a sluggish seasickness which brought no relies
was racking me, the sort that upsets the liver without
clearing it. Therefore l laid down the law to my
pilot, forcing him to make for the shore, willy-nilly.
¹ When we drew near, I did not wait for things to be
done in accordance with Vergil’s orders, until

, Prow faced seawards α
or
Anchor plunged from bow 3⁶

Ι remembered my profession ⁶ as a veteran devotee of
eold water, and, clad as 1 was in my cloak, let myself

What do you think my feelings were, scrambling
over the rocks, searching out the path, or making
{one for myself? Ι understood that sailors have good
reason to sear the land. It is hard to believe what
1 endured when I could not endure myself3 you may
'be sure that the reason why Ulysses was shipwrecked
η, on every possible occasion was not so much because
the sea—god was angry with him from his birth3 he
' was simply subject to seasickness. And in the future
, 1 also, if 1 must go anywhere by sea, shall only reach
my destination in the twentieth year.d
= When 1 finally calmed my stomach (for you
kknow that one does not escape seasickness by escaping
bom the sea) and refreshed my body with a rub-
down,1 began to reflect how completely we forget
or ignore our failings, even those that affect the body,
which are continually reminding us of their existence,
·—-not to mention those which are more serious in

portion as they are more hidden. A slight ague
,εάνω us; but when it has increased and a genuine

&ver bas begun to burn, it forces even a hardy ῐῐέαὲιιέ
