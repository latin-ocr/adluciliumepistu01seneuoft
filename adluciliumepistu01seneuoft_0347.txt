{3 XLIX. ΟΝ ΤΗΕ SHORTNESS OF LIFE ’

Α man is indeed lazy and careless, my dear
¹ acilius, if he is reminded of a friend only by seeing
l: me landscape which stirs the memory 3 and yet
ere are times when the old familiar haunts stir up
l⁴ sense of loss that has been stored away in the soul,
η ot bringing back dead memories, but rousing them
,ἰ m their 'dormant state, just as the sight of a lost
[ι 'end’s favourite slave, or his cloak, or his house,
2 · ews the mourner's grief, even though it has been
Ι ·ftened by time.
⁷ Now, lo and behold, Campania, and especially
· aples and your beloved Pompeii,‘² struck me, when
viewed them, with a wonderfully fresh sense of
0nging for you. You stand in full view before my
es. Ι am on the point of parting from you. 1
’ * you choking down your tears and resisting
*without success the emotions that well up at the
.. · moment when you try to check them. Ι seem
ἕω have lost you but a moment ago. For what is
ι “ but a moment ago ” when one begins to use
' ¹2 · memory? It was but a moment ago that I sat,
ῃ a lad, in the school of the philosopher Sotion,⁶ but
imoment ago that 1 began to plead in the courts,
’ · a moment ago that Ι lost the desire to plead,
t a moment ago that Ι lost the ability. Infinitely
” is the ssight of time, as those see more clearly
s · are looking backwards. For when we are intent
’ ιβ the present, we do not notice it, so gentle is
mass 'mm ἓξὲξ isszmz
. υ ; it all presents the same aspect to us, it lies
·· her. Everything slips into the same abyss.
