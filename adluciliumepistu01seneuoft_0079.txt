EPISTLE IX.

all with me l '' In other words, he deemed nothing
that might be taken from him to be a good.

’ We marvel at certain animals because they can
pass through fire and suffer no bodily harm3 but how
much more marvellous is a man who has marched
forth unhurt and unscathed through fire and sword
and devastation! Do you understand now how
much easier it is to conquer a whole tribe than to
conquer one man. Ρ This saying of Stilbo makes
common ground with Stoicism; the Stoic also can
carry his goods unimpaired through cities that have
been burned to ashes; for he is self- sufficient. Such
are the bounds which he sets to his own happiness

But you must not think that our school alone can
utter noble words; Epicurus himself, the reyiler of
Stilb0, spoke similar language‘²; put it down to my
credit, though 1 have already wiped out my debt for

the praeent day.⁶ He says: “ Whoever does not , ’

what he has as most ample wealth, is unhappy,
though he be master of the whole world.'’ Or, if
the following seems to you a more suitable phrase, —
for we must try to render the meaning and not the
mere words: “A man may rule the world and still
be unhappy, if he does not feel that he is supremely
ppy. ” In order, however, that you may know
t these sentiments are universal,⁶ suggested, of
rse, by Nature, you will find in one of the comic

ts this verse:

Unblest ns he who thinks himself unblestst

bor what does your condition matter, if it is bad in
'your own ey es? You may say: “What then? lf
under man, rich by base means, and yonder man,
of many but slave os more, shall call themselves
happy, will their own opinion make them happy?”
