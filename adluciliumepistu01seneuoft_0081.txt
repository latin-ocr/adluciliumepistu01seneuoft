EPISTLES lx„ X.

:It matters not what one sayS‚ but what one feels;
⁸a1so, not how one feels on one particular day, but
‘how one feels at all times. There is no reason,
thowever, why you should fear that this great privilege
will fall into unworthy hands; only the wise man is
'pleased with his own. Folly is ever troubled with
weariness of itself. Farewell.

  
  
     
   

X. ΟΝ LIVING ΤΟ ONESELF

YeS, 1 do not change my opinion : avoid the many,
yvoid the few, avoid even the individual. Ι know
of no one with whom I should be willing to have you
shared. And see what an opinion of you 1 have ; for
1 dare to trust you with your own self. Crates, they
ny, the disciple of the very Stilbo whom Ι mentioned
in a former letter, noticed a young man walking by
himself, and asked him what he was doing all alone.
“1 am cominuning with myself‚'’ replied the youth.
“ Pray be careful, then‚” said Crates, “and take
good heed ; you are communing with a bad man! ”
When persons are in mourning, or fearful about
Qnetffing, we are accustomed to watch them that
” may prevent them from making a wrong use of
&teir loneliness. No thoughtless person ought to be
mlonae in such cases he only plans folly, and

⁷ up future dangers for himself or for others ; he
Ungi! into play his base desires; the mind displays
'bnt fear or shame used to repress3 it whets his
bldnesffi stirs his passions, and goads his anger. And
finally, the only benefit that solitude confers,—the
hbit of trusting no man, and of fearing no witnesses,
—is lost to the fool; for he betrays himself.

Mark therefore what my hopes are for you‚—nay‚
