EPISTLE XXIV.

death and of life. For we need to be warned and
strengthened in both directionS,—not to love or to
hate lise overmuch3 even when reason advises us to
make an end of it, the impulse is not to be adopted
without reflection or at headlong speed. The brave
and wise man should not beat a hasty retreat from
life3 he should make a becoming exit. And above
all, he should avoid the weakness which has taken
possession of so many,—the lust for death. For just
as there is an unreflecting tendeucy of the mind
towards other things, so, my dear Lucilius, there is
an uni-eflecting tendency towards death; this osten
seizes upon the noblest and most spirited men, as
well as upon the craven and the abject. The former
despise life3 the latter find it irksome.

· Others also are moved by a satiety of doing and
seeing the same things, and not so much by a hatred
of life as because they are cloyed with it. We slip
into this condition, while philosophy itself pushes
us on, and we say: “ How long must I endure the
name things? Shall 1 continue to wake and sleep,
be hungry and be cloyed, shiver and perspire? There
an end to nothing3 all things are connected in a
rt of circle ; they flee and they are pursued. Night
close at the heels of day, day at the heels of night3
mmer ends in autumn, winter rushes after autumn,
d winter sostens into spring3 all nature in this
ay passes, only to return. 1 do nothing new ; Ι see
thing new; sooner or later one sickens of this,
There are many who think that living is not
⁶ sul, but superfluous. Farewell.
