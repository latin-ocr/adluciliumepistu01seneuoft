EPISTLE XLV.

deems happy, namely, he into whose coffers mighty
sums have flowed, but he whose possessions are all
in his soul, who is upright and exalted, who spurns
inconstancy, who sees no man with whom he wishes
to change places, who rates men only at their value
as men, who takes Nature for his teacher, conform-
ing to her laws and living as she commands, whom
no violence can deprive of his possessions‚ who turns
evil into good, is unerring in judgment, unshaken,
unafraid, who may be moved by force but never
moved to distraction, whom Fortune when she hurls
at him with all her might the deadliest missile in
her armoury, may graze, though rarely, but never
wound. For Fortune’s other missiles, with which
she vanquishes mankind in general, rebound from
such a one, like hail which rattles on the roof with
no barm to the dweller therein, and then melts away.

Why do you bore me with that which you your—
self call the “liar ” fallacy,⁰ about which so many books
have been written? Come now, suppose that my whole
life is a lie; prove that to be wrong and, if you are sharp
enough, bring that back to the truth. At present it
holds things to be essential of which the greater part
is superfluous, And even that which is not superfluous
is of no significance in respect to its power of making
one fortunate and blest. For if a thing be necessary,
it does not follow that it is a good. Else we degrade
the meaning of “ good,'’ if we apply that name to
breed and barley-porridge and other commodities
without which we cannot live. The good must in
every case be necessary3 but that which is necessary
in not in every case a good, since certain very paltry
things are indeed necessary. No one is to such an ex-
tent ignorant of the noble meaning of the word “good,”
ns to debase it to the level of these humdrum utilities.
