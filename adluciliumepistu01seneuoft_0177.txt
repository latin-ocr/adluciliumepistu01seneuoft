EPISTLE XXII.

which l am pondering? Read the letter of Epicurus ⁸
which bears on this matter; it is addressed to Ido-

meneus. The writer asks him to hasten as fast as
¹ he can, and beat a retreat before some stronger
influence comes between and takes from him the
liberty to withdraw. But he also adds that one
should attempt nothing except at the time when it
can be attempted suitably and seasonably. T hen,
when the long-sought occasion comes, let him be
up and doing. Epicurus forbidsb us to doze when
we are meditating escape3 he bids us hope for a
safe release from even the hardest trials, provided
that we are not in too great a hurry before the time,
nor too dilatory when the time arrives.

Now, I suppose, you are looking for a Stoic motto

its courage. You are perhaps expecting the sect to
utter such words as these: “ It is base to flinch
under a burden. Wrestle with the duties which you
have once undertaken. No man is brave and earnest
if he avoids danger, if his spirit does not grow with
the very difficulty of his task.’' Words like these will
indeed be spoken to you, if only your perseverance
shall have an object that is worth while, if only you
vill not have to do or to suffer anything unworthy
os a good man; besides, a good man will not waste
himself upon mean and discreditable work or be
busy merely sor the sake of being busy. Neither
vin he, as you imagine, become so involved in am-
bitious schemes that he will have continually to
endure their ebh and flow. Nay, when he sees the
‹langen-s, uncertainties, and hazards in which he was
brmerly tossed about, he will withdraw‚-not turn-
