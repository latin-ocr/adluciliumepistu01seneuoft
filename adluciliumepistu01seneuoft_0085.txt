EPISTLE XI.

xl. ΟΝ THE BLUSH OF MODESTY

Your friend and 1 have had a conversation. He
is a man of ability3 his very first words showed
what spirit and undet-standing he possesses, and what
progress he has already made. He gave me a fore-
taste, and he will not fail to answer theret0. For
he spoke not from forethought, but was suddenly
caught off his guard. When he tried to collect him-
self, he could scarcely banish that hue of modesty,
which is a good sign in a young man3 the blush
that spread over his face seemed so to rise from the
depths. And 1 feel sure that his habit of blushing
will stay with him after he has strengthened his
character, stripped off all his faults, and become wise.
For by no wisdom can natural weaknesses of the
body be removed. That which is implanted and
inborn can be toned down by training, but not over-
oome. The steadiest speaker,when before the public,
often breaks into a perspiration, as if he had wearied
or over-heated himself ; some tremble in the knees
when they rise to speak3 I know of some whose
teeth chatter, whose tongues salter, whose lips quiver.
Training and experience can never shake off this
habit3 nature exerts her own power and through
such a weakness makes her presence known even
to the strongest. 1 know that the blush, too, is a
habit of this sort, spreading suddenly over the fac'es
of the most dignified men, It is, indeed more
prevalent in youth, because of the warmer blood and
the sensitive countenance; nevertheless,both seasoned
men and aged men arc affected by it. Some are
most dangerous when they redden, as if they were
letting all their sense of shame escape. Sulla, when
