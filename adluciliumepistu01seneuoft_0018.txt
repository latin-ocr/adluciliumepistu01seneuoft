INTRODUCTION

to the Campanian earthquake of 63, a reference to
the conflagration at Lyons, which took place either

The form of this work, as Bacon says, is a col-

is often mentioned by name3 but his identity is
secondary to the main purpose. The language at

such an introduction, the writer takes up his theme ;
he deals with abstract subjects, such as the contempt
of death, the stout-heartedness of the sage, or the
quality of the Supreme Good. We shall not mention
the sources of all these topics in footnotes, but
shall aim only to explain that which is obscure in
meaning or unusual in its import. Plato’s Theory
of Ideas, Aristotle’s Categories, Theophrastus on

the handbook of the Elder Seneca.
