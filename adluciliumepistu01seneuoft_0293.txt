EPISTLE XL.

“ What then ? '' you say3 “ should not philosophy
sometimes take a loftier tone? ’' Of course she
should ; but dignity of character should be preserved,
and this is stripped away by such violent and exces-
sive force. Let philosophy possess great forces, but
kept well under control; let her stream flow un-
ceasingly, but never become a torrent. And 1 should
hardly allow even to an orator a rapidity of speech
like this, which cannot be called back, which goes
lawlessly ahead3 for how could it be followed by
jurors, who are osten inexperienced and untrained?
Even when the orator is carried away by his desire
to show off his powers, or by uncontrollable emotion,
even then he should not quicken his pace and heap
up words to an extent greater than the ear can endure.

You will be acting rightly, therefore, if you do
not regard those men who seek how much they may
say, rather than how they shall say it, and if for
yourself you choose, provided a choice must be
.made‚ to speak as Publius Vinicius the stammerer
does. When Asellius was asked how Vinicius spoke‚
he replied: “ Gradually”! (It was a remark of
Geminus Varius, by the way: “I don’t see how you
can call that man ‘ eloquent’ ; why, he can’t get out
three words together.”) Why, then, should you not
choose to speak as Vinicius does ? Though of course
nome wag may cross your path, like the person who
nid, when Vinicius was dragging out his words one
by one, as if he were dictating and not speaking:
“Say, haven't you anything to say ? ’' And yet that
were the better choice, for the rapidity of Quintus
Haterius, the most famous orator of his age, is, in
v'my opinion, to be avoided by a man of sense.
Haterius never hesitated‚ never paused ; he made
only one start, and only one stop!
