EPISTLE LVIII.

him aster his death, believing that his length of days
was too full for a mortal man, since he had rounded

’ out the perfect number of nine times nine. Ι do not

doubt that he would have been quite willing to forgo

Ἰ a few days from this total, as well as the sacrifice.

Frugal living can bring one to old age3 and to

2 my mind old age is not to be refused any more than
’ it is to be craved. There is a pleasure in being in
⁴ one’s own company as long as possible, when a man
’ has made himself worth enjoying. The question,
¹ therefore, on which we have to record our judgment

is, whether one should shrink from extreme old age

,. and should hasten the end artificially, instead of
’ waiting for it to come. A man who sluggishly
.- awaits his fate is almost a coward, just as he is im-

* moderately given to wine who drains the jar dry
⁹ and sucks up even the dregs. But we shall ask

this quoetion also: “Is the extremity of life the
dregs, or is it the clearest and purest part of all,
provided only that the mind is unimpaired, and the
sensoe, still sound, give their support to the spirit,
and the body is not worn out and dead before its
time?” For it makes a great deal of difference
whether a man is lengthening his life or his death.

¹ But if the body is useless for service, why should

one not free the stru ggling soul? Perhaps one
ought to do this a little before the debt is due, lest,
when it falls due, he may be unable to perform the

· act. And since the danger of living m wretchedness

is greater than the danger of dying soon, he is a fool

- who refuses to stake a little time and win a hazard

of great gain}⁸
Few have lasted through extreme old age to
death without impairment, and many have lain inert,
