IN TRODUCTION

The Epistles contain alm, of coisrse, the usual
literary types which every Roman epistolographei
would feel bound to introduce. There is the con-
solatio3 there is the theme of friendship3 there are
second-hand lectures on philosophy taken from Plato
and Aristotle and Theophrastus, as we have indi-
cated above3 and several characteristically Roman
laudations of certain old men (including the author
himself) who wrestle with physical infirmities. But
the Stoic doctrine is interpreted better, from the
Roman point of view, by no other Latin writer. The

facts of Seneca’s life prove the sincerity of his utter- ·

anceS, and blunt the edge of many of the sneers
which we find in Dio Cassius, regarding the fabulous
sums which he had out at interest and the costly
tables purchased for the palace of a millionaire.

Finally, in no pagan author, save perhaps Vergil,
is the beauty of holiness (XLI.) so sincerely presented
from a Roman standpoint. Although his connexion
with the early Church has been disproved, Seneca
shows the modern, the Christian, spirit. Three of
the ideals mentioned above, the hatred of combats
in the arena, the humane treatment of slaves, and
the sanctity of marriage, draw us towards Seneca as
towards a teacher like Jeremy Taylor.

There is no pretence of originality in the Latin
text3 the translator has adopted, with very few
deviations, that of O. Hense’s second edition. This
text he has found to be excellent, and he has also
derived assistance from the notes accompanying the
Selected Letters of W. C. Summers.
