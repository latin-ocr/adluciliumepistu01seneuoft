EPISTLE XXIV.

among many. ΓΙ may be exiled3 I shall then regard
myself as born in the place to which Ι shall be sent²¹
, They may put me in chains. What then? Am Ι
free from bonds now? Behold this clogging burden
of a body, to which nature has fettered me! “I
shall die,'’ you say; you mean to say “ I shall cease
to run the risk of sickness ; I shall cease to run the
risk of imprisonment; I shall cease to run the risk
of death.” 1 am not so foolish as to go through at
this juncture the arguments which Epicurus harps

that Sisyphus does not shoulder his stone uphill,
that a man's entrails cannot be restored and de-
vom-ed every day3· no one is so childish as to sear
CerberuS, or the shadows, or the spectral garb of
those who are held together by naught but their
nnfleshed bones. Death either annihilates us or
strips us bare. If we are then released, there re-
mains the better part, after the burden has been
‘thdrawm if we are annihilated, nothing remains3
and bad are alike removed.

Allow me at this point to quote a verse of youm,
suggesting that, when you wrote it, you meant
for yourseli' no less than for others. lt is ignoble
say one thing and mean another; and how much
ignoble to write one thing and mean another!
remember one day you were handling the well-
own commonplace,—that we do not suddenly fall
death, but advance towards it by slight degrees3
· e die every day. For every day a little of our life
taken from us; even when we are growing, our
e is on the wane. We lose our childhood, then
bo hood, and then our youth. Counting even
euterd'ay, all past time is lost time3 the very day
