EPISTLES XLI X„ L.

The language of truth is simple.

We should not, therefore, make that language in-
tricate; since there is nothing less fitting for a

L. ΟΝ OUR BLINDNESS AND ITS CU‘RE

1 received your letter many months after you had
posted it; accordingly, I thought it useless to ask the

.- carrier what you were busied with. He must have

a particularly good memory if he can remember that!
But Ι hope by this time you are living in such a way

, that I can be sure what it is you are busied with, no

 

matter where you may be. For what else are you
busied with except improving yourself every day,
laying aside some error, and coming to understand
that the faults which you attribute to circumstances
are in yourself ? We are indeed apt to ascribe certain
¹ faults to the place or to the time ; but those faults
ι will follow us, no matter how we change our place.
You know Harpaste, my wife's female clown3 she

has remained in my house, a burden incurred from a
‘ legacy. 1 particularly disapprove of these freaks;
³ whenever 1 wish to enjoy the quips of a clown, I am
not compelled to hunt far; 1 can laugh at myself.
Now this clown suddenly became blind. The story
ι sounds incredible‚ but I assure you that it is true:
she does not know that she is blind. She keeps
asking her attendant to change her quarters3 she
says that her apartments are too dark.

You can see clearly that that which makes us
smile in the case of Harpasta happens to all the rest
of ¹¹83 nobody undet-stands that he is himself greedy,
or that he is covetous Yet the blind ask for a guide‚
