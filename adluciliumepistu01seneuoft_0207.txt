With regard to these two friends of ours, we
must proceed along different lines; the faults of the
one are to be corrected, the other’s are to be crushed
out. 1 shall take every liberty ; for I do not love
this one· if 1 am unwilling to hurt his feelings.
“ What‚’' you say, “do you expect to keep a sorty-
year-old ward under your tutelage? Consider his
age, how hardened it now is, and past handling!
Such a man cannot be re-shaped3 only young minds

nense of shame enough to blush for his sins. This
hodesty should be fostered3 so long as it endures in
his seul, there is some room for hope. But as for
this veteran of yours, I think we should deal more

ut himself. There is no better time to approach
than now, when he has an interval of rest and
ms like one who has corrected his faults. Others
ve been cheated by this interval of virtue on his
, but he does not cheat me. I feel sure that
ese faults will return, as it were, with compound
, rest, for just now, I am certain, they are in
yance but not absent. 1 shall devote some time
the matter, and try to see whether or not some-
ing can be done.
