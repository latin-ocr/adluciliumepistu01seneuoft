EPISTLE XXII.

earry away with you, and how much money you may
keep to equip yourself for the life of leisure, you will
never find a way out. No man can swim ashore and
take his baggage with him. Rise to a higher life,
with the favour of the gods; but let it not be favour
of such a kind as the gods give to men when with
kind and genial faces they bestow magnificent ills,
justified in so doing by the one fact that the things
which irritate and torture have been bestowed in
answer to prayer.

1 was just putting the seal upon this letter; but
it must be broken again, in order that it may go to
you with its customary contribution, bearing with it
some noble word. And lo, here is one that occurs
to my mind3 1 do not know whether its truth or its
nobility of utterance is the greater. “ Spoken by
whom?’‘ you ask. By Epicurus⁶; for I am still
appropriating other men’s belongings. The words
are: “ Everyone goes out of life just as if he had
but lately entered it.’—’ Take anyone off his guard,
—young, old, or middle-aged; you will find that all
tre equally afraid of death, and equally ignorant ot
life. No one has anything finished, because we
have ke t putting off into the future all our under-
bkings. No thought in the quotation given above

leases me more than that it taunts old men with

ing insants. “No one,” he says, “leaves this
world in a different manner from one who has just
en born.'’ That is not true; for we are worse
hen we die than when we were born; but it is
r fault, and not that of Nature. Nature should
’ ld us, saying: “ What does this mean? 1 brought
α into the world without desires or fearS, free from
ffifsststiom treachfiry and thte 0511ιεῖ1· curses. Go

as you were w en you en ere .
