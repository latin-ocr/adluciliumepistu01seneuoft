EPIST LE XL.

However, I suppose that certain styles of speech
are more or less suitable to nations also ; in a Greek
you can put up with the unrestrained style, but we
Romans, even when writing, have become accustomed

   
   
    
   
   
   
     

to separate our words! And our compatriot Cicero,
with whom Roman oratory sprang into prominence,
was also a slow pacerJ’ The Roman language is
more inclined to take stock of itself, to weigh, and to
offer something worth weighing. Fabianus, a man
noteworthy because of his life, his knowledge, and,
laes important than either of these, his eloquence also,
used to discuss a subject with dispatch rather than
with haste ; hence you might call it ease rather than
speed. Ι approve this quality in the wise man ; but
1 do not demand it; only let his speech proceed
unhampered, though Ι prefer that it should be
deliberately uttered rather than spouted.

However, 1 have this further reason for frightening
you away from the latter malady, namely, that you
could only be successful in practising this style by
tlosing your sense of modesty ; you would have
tto rub all shame from your countenance,⁰ and refuse
sto hear yourself speak. For that heedless flow will
'carry with it many expressions which you would
'lvish to criticize. And, 1 repeat, you could not⁴
tain it and at the same time preserve your sense

shame. Moreover, you would need to practise
ery day, and transfer your attention from subject
tter to words. But words, even if they came to
ou readily and flowed without any exertion on your
, yet would have to be kept under control. For
Just as a less ostentatione gait becomes a philosopher,
does a restrained style of speech, far removed from
boldness. Therefore, the ultimate kernel of my re·,
marks is this: 1 bid you be slow of speech. Farewell.
