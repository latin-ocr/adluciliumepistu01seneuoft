, we must take counsel in the presence of the actual
situation. You must be not only present in the

   
   
    
     
     
   
   
  
   

body, but watchful in mind, if you would avail your-
sels of the fleeting opportunity. Accordingly, look
about you for the opportunity3 if you see it, grasp
it, and with all your energy and with all your
strength devote yourself to this task,—-to rid yourself
of those business duties.

Now listen carefully to the opinion which Ι shall
offer ; it is my opinion that you should withdraw
either from that kind of existence, or else from ex-
istence altogether. But Ι likewise maintain that
you should take a gentle path, that you may loosen
rather than eut the knot which you have bungled
so badly in tying,—provided that if there shall be
no other way of loosening it, you may actually cut
it„ No man is so faint-hearted that he would rather
hang in suspense for ever than drop once for all.
Meanwhile‚—and this is of first importance,—-do net
lumper yourself3 be content with the business into
hich you have lowered yourself, or, as you prefer
have people think, have tumbled. There is no
reason why you should be struggling on to some-
thing further3 if you do, you will lose all grounds of
excuse, and rnen will see that it was not a tumble.
The usual explanation which men offer is wrong:
θ’ 1 was compelled to do it. Suppose it was against
my will: 1 had to do it.” But no one is compelled
fio pursue prosperity at top speed3 it means some-
thing to call a halt,—even if one does not offer re-
ce,—instead of pressing eagerly after favouring
ne. Shall you then be put out with me, if Ι
only come to advise you, but also call in others
advise you,—wiser heads than my own, men
ore whom 1 am wont to lay any problem upon
