LVII. ΟΝ THE TRIALS OF TRAVEL

When it was time for me to return to Naples
from Baiae, l easily persuaded myself that a storm

and yet the road was so deep in mud, all the way,
that 1 may be thought none the less to have made a
voyage. On that day 1 had to endure the full fate
of an athlete; the anointinga with which we began
was followed by the sand-sprinkle in the Naples
munel) No place could be longer than that prison;
unothing could be dimmer than those torcheS, which
⁴enabled us, not to see amid the darkness, but to see
the darkness. But, even supposing that there was
{light in the place, the dust‚ which is an oppressiva
md disagreeable thing even in the open air, would
destroy the light; how much worse the dust is
there, where it rolls back upon itself, and, being
:hut in without ventilation, blows back in the faces
uf those who set it going! So we endured two
heonveniences at the same time, and they were
diametrically different: we struggled both with
'mud and with dust on the same road and on the
nme da .

η The ἔίοοω, however, furnished me with some food
{fin- thought; l felt a certain mental thrill, and a trans·
{armation unaccompanied by sear, due to the novelty
’ and the unpleasantness osan unusual occurrence. Of
x&nurse l am not speaking to you of myself at this
npolnt, because 1 am far from being a perfect person,
Gr even a man of middling qualities; 1 refer to one
over whom fortune has lost her control. Even such
ι man's mind will be smitten witb a thrill and

was raging, that 1 might avoid another trip by sea3 ·
