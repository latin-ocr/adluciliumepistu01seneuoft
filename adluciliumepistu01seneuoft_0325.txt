EPISTLES XLVI., XLVII.

any postponement. The sunlight called 'to me,
hunger warned, and clouds were lowering3 but I
absorbed the book from beginning to end.

1 was not merely pleased3 1 rejoiced. So full of
wit and spirit it was! 1 should have added “ force,''
had the book contained moments of repose, or had it
risen to energy only at intervals. But I found that
there was no burst of force, but an even flow, a
style that was vigorous and chaste. Nevertheless
1 noticed from time to time your sweetness, and
here and there that mildness of yours. Your style
is losty and noble; 1 want you to keep to this
manner and this direction. -Your subject also
contributed something; for this reason you should
choose productive topics, which will lay hold of the
mind and arouse it.

1 shall discuss the book more fully after a second
perusal3 meantime, my judgment is somewhat
unsettled‚ just as if 1 had heard it read aloud, and ”
had not read it myself. You must allow me to
examine it also. You need not be afraid ; you shall
hear the truth. Lucky fellow, to offer a man no
opportunity to tell you lies at such long range!
Unless perhaps, even now, when excuses for lying
are taken away, custom serves as an excuse for our
telling each other lies! F arewell.

XLVII. ΟΝ MASTER AND SLAVE

1 am glad to learn, through those who come from l

, you, that you live on friendly terms with your slaves.
‘ Thia befits a sensible and well-educated man like s] l

 

'- your-aelf. “They are slave8‚” people declare.“ Nay,
ψ rather they are men. “Slaves!” No, comrades.
