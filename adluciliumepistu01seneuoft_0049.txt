r are, keep step together3 fear follows hope. I am
ἱ not surprised that they proceed in this way3 each
’ alike belongs to a mind that is in suspense, a mind

 

that is fretted by looking forward to the future.
But the chief cause of both these ills is that we do
not adapt ourselves to the present, but send our
thoughts a long way abead. And so foresight, the
noblest blessing of the human race, becomes per-
verted. Beasts avoid the dangers which they see,
and when they have escaped them are free from
care; but we men torment ourselves over that which
is to come as well as over that which is past. Many
os our blessings bring bane to us ; for memory recalls
·the tortures of sear, while foresight anticipates them.
, Τὴε present alone can make no man wretched.
Farewell.

1 feel, my dear LuciliuS, that 1 am being not only
reformed, but transformed. 1 do not yet, however,
assure myself, or indulge the hope, that there are no
elements left in me which need to be changed. Of
course there are many that should be made more
compact, or made thinner, or be brought into
greater prominence. And indeed this very fact is
proof that my spirit is altered into something better,
’ —that it can see its own faults, of which it was
previously ignorant. In certain cases sick men are
congratulated because they themselves have per-
ceived that they are sick.

1 therefore wish to impart to you this sudden
change in mysels; 1 should then begin to place a
turer trust in our friendship,—the true friendship,
