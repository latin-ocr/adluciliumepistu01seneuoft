1 confess that we all have an inborn affection for
our body; Ι confess that we are entrusted with its
guardianship. 1 do not maintain that the body is

comforts as well as dangerS, and withdraw to safe
ground, by thinking continually how we may repe]

three main classes of these: we fear want, we fear
sickness, and we sear the troubles which result from
the violence of the stronger. And of all these, that

evils which I have mentioned,— want and sickness,
—stcal upon us silently with no shock of terror to
the eye or to the ear. The other kind of evil comes,
