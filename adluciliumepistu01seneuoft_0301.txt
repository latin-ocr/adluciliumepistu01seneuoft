own} For what is more foolish than to praise in a
man he qualities which come from without? And
what is more insane than to marvel at characteristics
which may at the next instant be passed on to
someone else? A golden bit does not make a
better horse. The lion with gilded mane, in process
of being trained and forced by weariness to endure
the decoration, is sent into the arena in quite a

wild appearance,—and it is his glory that none can
look upon him without fear,—is favoureda in pre-
