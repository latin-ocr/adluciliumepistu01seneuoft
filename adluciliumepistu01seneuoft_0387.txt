EPISTLE LIV.

test me? Let it do so3 Ι myself have for a long time
'tested death.’' “When?'' you ask. Before 1 was
born. Death is non-existence, and l. know already
what that means. What was before me will happcn

thinking that death only follows, when in reality it
'has both preceded us and will in turn follow us.
