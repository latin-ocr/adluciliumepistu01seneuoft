INTRODUCI'ION

F riendship, Epicurus on Pleasure, and all the count-
less doctrinal shades of difference which we find in
the Stoic leaders, are at least sketched in outline.
But we must give full credit to the philosopher's
own originality. In these letters, it is impossible
to ignore the advance from a somewhat stiff and

x Ciceronian point of view into the attractive and

Ι debatable laud of what one may fairly call modern
’ ideas. The style of the Epistles is bold, and so is
the thought.

Considered en masse, the letters form a fruitful
and helpsul handbook, of the very widest scope
and interest. The value of intelligent reading and
the studioe which make for culture is presented to
Lucilius with frequency, notably in Nos. II. and
LXXXVIII. Seneca agrees with the definition of
higher studies as “ those which have no reference to

mere utility.’' Τὴε dignity of the orator’s profession
(XL. and CXIV.) is brought to the attention of

Ἴ a young self—made merchant who seems inclined

towards platform display. The modern note is
struck when the author protests against the swinish

Ϊ and debasing effects of slavery or gladiatorial com-
bats (XLVII. and LXX.); preaches against the

degeneracy of drunkenness (LXXXIII.); portrays
the charms of plain living and love of nature
(LV11., LXVII„ LXXIX„ LXXXVI„ LXXXVII.,
XC„ xclv.); recommends retirement (XVIII., LI.‚
LVI„ LXXX„ CXXII.); or manifests a Baconian
interoet in scientific inventions (LV11„ Lxxlx.).
Most striking of all is the plea (xC1V.) for the

¹ equality of the sexes and for conjuga! fidelity in the

 

husband, to be interpreted no less strictly than honour
on the part of the wife. The craze for athletics is
also analyzed and rebuked (XV.)
