EPISTLE XXVI.

peace of spirit and moderation of character Ι owe to
wisdom and how much to my time of life; it bids me
distinguish carefully what l cannot do and what I do
not want to do. . . . For why should one complain
or regard it as a disadvantage, if powers which ought
to come to an end have failed? “ But,'’ you say, “it
Ι is the greatest possible disadvantage to be worn out
and to die off‚' or rather, if 1 may speak literally, to
melt away! For we are not suddenly smitten and
laid low-3 we are worn away, and every day reduces
our powers to a certain extent.”

  
    
    
    
    
  
    
     
     

But is there any better end to it all than to glide
off to one’s proper haven, when nature slips the
cable? Not that there is anything painful in a shock
and a sudden departure from existence; it is merely
because this other way of departure is easy,—a
gradual withdrawal. 1, at any rate, as if the test
were at hand and the day were come which is to
pronounce its decision concerning all the years of my
life, watch over myself and commune thus with
myself: “The showing which we have made up to
the present time, in word or deed, counts for nothing.
All this is but a trifling and deceitful pledge of our
spirit, and is wrapped in much charlatanism. I shall
leave it to Death to determine what progress Ι have
made. Therefore with no faint beart I ain making
ready for the day when, putting aside all stage
artifice and actor's rouge, Ι am to pass judgment
upon myself‚—whether 1 am merely declaiming
brave sentimenta, or whether Ι really feel them;
bether all the bold threats Ι have uttered against
ortune are a pretence and a farce. Put aside the
inion of the world3 it is always wavering and
ways takes both sideS. Put aside the studies
hich you have pursued throughout your life;
