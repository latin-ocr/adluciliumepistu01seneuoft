EPISTLES XLIV„ XLV.

ἰ 'ngs come, but to the goal towards which they
nd. If there is anything that can make life happy,
it is good on its own merits; for it cannot degenerate
⁰ to evil. Where, then, lioe the mistake, since all
en orave the happy life? It is that they regard
e means for producing happiness as happiness itself,
d, while secking happiness, they are really fleeing
m it. For although the sum and substance of the
ppy life is unalloyed freedom from care, and though
e secret of such freedom is unshaken confidence,
et men gather together'that which causes worry,
d, while travelling life’s treacherous road, not only
ve burdens to bear, but even draw burdens to
emselves3 hence they recede farther and fa'rther
from the achievement of that which they seek, and
the more effort they expend, the more they hinder
emselvoe and are set back. This is what happens
hen you hurry through a maze ; the faster you go,
e worse you are entangled. F arewell.

    
  
      
     
    
    
      
   
   

(LV. ΟΝ SOPHISTICAL ARGUMENTATION

You complain that in your part of the world there
a scant supply of books. But it is quality, rather
n quantity, that matters; a limited list of reading
efits3 a varied assortment serves only for delight.
e who would arrive at the appointed end must
llow a single road and not wander through many
ys. What you suggest is not travelling3 it is
re tramping.

“But‚” you say, “ 1 should rather have you give
advice than book8.” Still,1 am ready to send
all the books I have, to ransack the whole store-
ωε.. 1f it were possible, 1 should join you there
