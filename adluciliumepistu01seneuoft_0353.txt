EPISTLE XLIX.

¹ mighty undertaking is on my hands. What am 1
¹{to do? Death is on my trail, and life is fleeting
away3 teach me something with which to face these
troubles. Bring it to pass that Ι shall cease trying

'to escape from death, and that life may cease to
{escape from me. Give me courage to meet hard-
}ships3 make me calm in the face of the unavoid-
able. Relax the straitened limits of the time which
is allotted me. Show me that the good in life
does not depend upon life’s length, but upon the
use we make of it; also, that it is possible, or
rather usual, for a man who has lived long to have
lived too little. Say to me when 1 lie down to
sleep: “You may not wake again!” And when I
have waked: “You may not go to sleep again! ’'
Say to me when I go forth from my house: “You
may not return!” And when I return: “You
may never go forth again ! '' You are mistaken
if you think that only on an ocean voyage there
is a very slight spacess between life and death.
No, the distance between is just as narrow every-
where. It is not everywhere that death shows
{himself so near at hand; yet everywhere he is as
anoefiidt ἓέῃξῖ these shadowy terrors , then you will
more easily deliver to me the instruction for which
1 have prepared myself. At our birth nature made
ns teachable‚ and gave us reason, not perfect, but

pable of being perfected. Discuss for me justice,
uty, thrift, and that twofold purity, both the
ty which abstains from another’s person, and

t which takes care of one’s own self. If you will
