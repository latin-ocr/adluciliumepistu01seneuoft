³ the word when we wish to indicate a happy state of
·..·nd. 1 am aware that if we test words by our
*formulast even pleasure is a thing of ill repute, and
’ joy can be attained only by the wise. For “joy ’' is
311 elation of spirit, —of a spirit which trusts in the
goodness and truth of its own possessions. The
„common usage, however, is that we derive great
W joy’ ’from a friend' 3 position as consul, or from his
Ἃ...» ’380, or from the birth of 1113 child3 but these
'‘·,vents so far from being matters of joy, are more
‘osten the beginnings of sorrow to come. No, it is
ι characteristic of real joy that it never ceases, and
:never changes into its opposite-¹²
1} Accordingly, when our Vergil speaks of

ξι, The evil joys of the minda

words are eloquent, but not strictly appropriate.
For no‘ ‘joy' 'can· ·be evil. He 1133 given the name
Ι ''T“ Joy ’⁹ to pleasures, and has thus expressed his
Α eaning. For he has conveyed the idea that men
0 delight in their own evil. Nevertheless,1 was
Ἃ · wrong in saying that 1 received great‘ ‘pleasure'’
· ’ ἰι your letter3 for although an ignorantd man may
ᾗ s· > ’νο“ joy’ ’if the cause be an honourable one, yet,
· 00 1113 emotion is wayward, and is likely soon to
, 0 another direction, 1 call it‘ ‘pleasure’' ;for it
ν inspired by an opinion concerning a spurious good3
'- exceeds control and is carried to excess.
But, to return to the subject, let me tell you
A hat delighted me in your letter. You have your
l orda under control. You are not carried away by
¹ · ο 1311811380, or borne beyond the limits which you
ve determined upon. Many writers are tempted
