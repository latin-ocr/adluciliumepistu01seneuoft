 

EPISTLE XIII.

’ things which cause our fear3 we do not examine
into them; we blench and retreat just like soldiers
who are forced to abandon their camp because of a
dust-cloud raised by stampeding cattle, or are thrown
into a panic by the spreading of some unauthentic-
ated rumour. And somehow or other it is the idle
report that disturbs us most. For truth has its own
definite boundaries‚ but that which arises from un-
certainty is delivered over to guesswork and the
irresponsible license of a frightened mind. That is
why no sear is so ruinou's and so uncontrollable as
panic sear. For other fears are groundless, but this
sear is witless.

Let us, then, look carefully into the matter. It
is likely that some troubles will befall us; but it is
not a present fact. How often has the unexpected
happened! How often has the expected never come
to pass! And even though it is ordained to be, what
does it avail to run out to meet your suffering? You
will suffer soon enough, when it arrivcs; so look
forward meanwhile to better things. What shall

The mind at times fashions for itself false shapes
of evil when there are no signs that point to any
evil ; it twists into the worst construction some word
