EPISTLE LII.

. time to help you. We can get assistance not only from]
the living, but from those of the past. Let us choose,
however, from among the living, not men who pour
forth their words with the greatest glibness, turning
out commonplaces, and holding, as it were, their own l f>
little private exhibitions,“—not these, I say, but men
’ who teach us by their lives, men who tell us what we
ought to do and then prove it by practice, who show
us what we should avoid, and then are never caught
. doing that which they have ordered us to avoid.

fl Choose as a guide one whom you will admire more
when you see him act than when you hear him speak2]
Of course 1 would not prevent you from listening
also to those philosophers who are wont to hold
1 public meetings and discussions, provided they appear
before the people for the express purpose of improving
themselves and others, and do not practise their
profession for the sake of sels-secking. For what is
baser than philosophy courting applause? Does the
“ sick man praise the surgeon while he is operating?
In silence and with reverent awe submit to the
cureJ’ Even though you cry applause, I shall listen
to your crioe as if you were groaning when your sores
, were touched. Do you wish to bear witness that you
’ are attenfive, that you are stirred by the grandeur
v of the subject? You may do this at the proper time ;
l shall of course allow you to pass judgment and cast
a vote as to the better course. Pythagoras made his
pupils keep silence for five years3 do you think that
they had the right on that account to break out
immediately into applause?

How mad is he who leaves the lecture-room in a
happy frame of mind simply because of applause from
the ignorant! Why do you take pleasure in being
praised by men whom you yourself cannot praise?
