EPISTLE XXX.

in an old man's body, there is a certain limit up to
which you can sustain and prop its weakness. But

¹ when it comes to resemble a decrepit building‚—
Ὗ, when every joint begins to spread and while one
⁴ is being repaired another falls apart‚—then it is time

 

for a man to look about him and consider how he

But the mind of our friend Bassus is active.
Philosophy bestows this boon upon us; it makes us
joyful in the very sight of death, strong and brave
no matter in what state the body may be, cheerful
and never failing though the body fail us. A great
pilot can sail even when his canvas is rent; if his
ship be dismantled, he can yet put in trim what
remains of her hull and hold her to her course. This
is what our friend Bassus is doing; and he contem-
plates his own end with the courage and countenance
which you would regard as undue indifference in a
man who so contemplated another’s.

This is a great accomplishment, LuciliuS, and one
which needs long practice to leam,—to depart calmly
when the inevitable hour arrives. Other kinds of
death contain an ingr-edient of hope ε a disease comes
to an end; a fire is quenched; falling houses have
set down in safety those whom they seemed certain
to crush; the sea has cast ashore unharmed those
whom it had engulfed‚ by the same force through
which it drew them down; the soldier has drawn
back his sword from the very neck of his doomed
soe. But those whom old age is leading away to
death have nothing to hope sor3 old age alone

ts no reprieve. No ending, to be sure, is more
painlesa; but there is none more lingering.

Our friend Bassus seemed to me to be attending
his own funeral, and layingput his own body for
