’ INTRODUCHON

travelling about southern Italy, composing essays on
natural history and relieving his burdened soul by
cortes ndence with his friend Lucilius. In the
year 5 came his suicide, anticipating an act of
violence on the Emperor’s part3 in this deed of
heroism he was nobly supported by his young wife
‚Paulina The best account of these dark days is
given in Tacitus.

Tbese letters are all addressed to Lucilius. From
internal evidence we gather that the native country
of this Lucilius was Campania, and his native
city Pompeii or Naples. He was a Roman knight‚
having gained that position, as Seneca tells us, by
sheer industry. Prominent in the civil service, he
had filled many important positions and was, at the
time when the Leuers were written, procurator in
Sicily. He seems to have had Epicurean tendencies,
like so many men from this part of Italy; the
author argues and tries to win him over to Stoicism‚
in the kindliest manner. Lucilius wrote books, was
interaeted in philosophy and geography, knew in-
timately many persons in high places, and is thought
by some to be the author of the extant poem Aetna.

When their friendship began we cannot say.
The Naturales Quaestiones and the Letters are the
work of Seneca's closing years. Both are addressed
to Lucilius. The essay De Providentia, which was
also dedicated to him, is of doubtful date, and may
be fixed at any time between the beginning of the

¹ exile in Corsica and the period when the Letlers

were written.

In spite of the many problems which confront us,
it may be safel said that the years 63- 65 constitute
the period of tile Leuers. Wey find possible allusions
