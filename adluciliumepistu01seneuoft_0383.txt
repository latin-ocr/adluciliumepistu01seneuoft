, then ? Shall you not do the same thing now ? Throw
aside all hindrances and give up your time to getting

¹ terrers by the bounty of nature, the wise man by his
own bounty. that a wonderful privilege, to have
the weaknesses of a man and the serenity of a god!
' The power of philosophy to blunt the blows of
chance is beyond belief. No missile can settle in
lber body; she is well-protected and impenetrable.
