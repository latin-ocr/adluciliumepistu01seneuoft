LII. ΟΝ CHOOSING OUR TEACHERS

that is this force, Lucilius, that drags us in one
direction when we are aiming in another, urging us
on to the exact place from which we long to with-

blenda the way, but who will follow faithfully. Of
these, he says, Metrodorus was one; this type of
'man is also excellent, but belongs to the second grade.
