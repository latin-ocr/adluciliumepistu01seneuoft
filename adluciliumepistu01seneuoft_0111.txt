EPISTLE XIV.

so to speak, in the form of a huge parade. Sur-
rounding it is a retinue of swords and fire and chains

aud 3 mob of beasts to be let loose upon the dis- *

embowelled entrails of men. Picture to yourself
under this head the prison, the cross, the rack, the

hook, and the stake which they drive straight '

through a man until it protrudes from his throat.
Think of human limbs torn apart by chariots driven
in opposite directions, of the terrible shirt smeared
and interwoven with inflammable materials, and of
all the other contrivances devised by cruelty, in
addition to those which I have mentioned1“ It is
not surprising, then, if our greatest terror is of such
3 fate; for it comes in many shapes and its para-
phernalia are terrifying. For just as the torturer
accomplishes more in proportion to the number of
instruments which he displays,—indeed‚ the spectacle
overcomes those who would have patiently withstood
the suffering,—similarly, of all the agencies which
coerce and master our minds, the most effective are
those which can make a display. Those other
troubles are of course not less serious; I mean
hunger, thirst, ulcers of the stomach, and sever that
perches our very bowels. They are, however, secret ;
they have no bluster and no heralding3 but these,
like huge arrays of war, prevail by virtue of their
display and their equipment.

Let u3‚ therefore, see to it that we abstain from
giving offence. lt is sometimes the people that we
ought to fear; or sometimes a body of influential
oligarchs in the Senate‚ if the method of governing
the State is such that most of the business is done
by that body; and sometimes individuals equipped
with power by the people and against the people.
lt is burdensomc to keep the friendship of all such
