strike out into the midst of the billows and, welcom-
ing a stormy existence, wrestle daily in hardihood
of soul with life’s problems. The wise man will
endure all that, but will not choose it ; he will prefer
to be at peace rather than at war. It helps little
to have cast out your own faults if you must quarrel

and he who 1133 scorned it is free,-no matter amid
how large a mob of over-lords he stands.

It is time to stop, but not before I have paid
duty. “The knowledge of sin is the beginning of
salvation.” This saying of Epicurus‘² seems to me

hunt up charges against yourself3 play the part, first
of accuser, then of judge, last of intercessor. At
times be harsh with yourself.⁶ Farewell.
