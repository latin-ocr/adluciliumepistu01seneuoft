THE EPISTLES OF SENECA
1. ON SAVING TIMF.

Greetings from Seneca to his friend Lucilius.

Cosrmus to act thus, my dear Lucilius—set your-
self free for your own sake; gather and save your
time, which till lately has been forced from you, or
filched away, or has merely slipped from your hands.
Make yourself believe the truth of my words,—that
certain moments are torn from uS, that some are
gently removed, and that others glide beyond our
reach. The most disgraceful kind of loss, however,
is that due to carelessness. Furthermore‚ if you
will pay close heed to the problem, you will find
that the largest portion of our life passes while we
are doing ill, a goodly share while we are doing
nothing, and the whole while we are doing that

χ which is not to the purpose. What man can you ’
³ show me who places any value on his time, who r f

³ reckons the worth of each day, who understands

that he is dying daily? For we are mistaken when
we look forward to death ; the major portion of death
has already passed. Whatever years lie behind us
are in death’s hands.

Theresore, LuciliuS, do as you write me that you
are doing: hold every hour in your grasp. Lay hold
of tmday's task, and you will not need to depend so
much upon to-morrow's, While we are postponing,
