EPISTLE XV.

' well to say: “If you are studying philosophy, it is
well.’' For this is just what “being well” means.
Without philosophy the mind is sickly, and the
body, too, though it may be very powerful, is strong
only as that of a madman or a lunatic is strong. This,
then, is the sort of health you should primarily cultiv-
ate3 the other kind of health comes second, and will
involve little effort, if you wish to be well physically. 'K
lt is indeed foolish, my dear Lucilius, and very un-
suitable for a cultivated man, to work hard over
developing the muscles and broadening the shoulders
and ‘strengthening the lungs. For although your
heavy feeding produce good results and your sinews
grow solid, you can never be a match, either in
strength or in weight, for a first-class bull. Besides,
by overloading the body with food you strangle the
soul and render it less active. Accordingly, limit
the flesh as much as possible, and allow free play to
the spirit. Many inconveniences beset those who
¹ devote themselves to such pursuits. In the first
2 place, they have their exercises‚ at which they must
ἓ» work and' waste their life-force and render it less fit
ις to bear a sti-ain or the severer studies. Second,
a their keen edge is dulled by heavy eating. Resides,
they must take orders from slaves of the vilest
us stamp,-—men who alternate between the oil-flask“
d the flagon, whose day passes satisfactorily if
hey have got up a good perspiration and quaffed, to
ake good what they 'have lost in sweat, huge
raughts of liquor which will sink deeper because of
(Τὼ eirdfiisting. 'Prinking and sweating,—it’s the life
, a yspeptic .

. Now there are short and simple exercises which tire
e body rapidl , and so save our time; and time is
mething of w ich we ought to keep strict account.
