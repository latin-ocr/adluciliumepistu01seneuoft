EPISTLES XXXI 1., XXXIII.

Your parents, to be sure, asked other blessings for
you; but Ι myself pray rather that you may despise
all those things which your parents wished for you
in abundance. Their prayers plunder many another
person, simply that you may be enriched. Whatever
they make over to you must be removed from
someone else. I pray that you may get such control
over yourself that your mind, now shaken by wander-
ing thoughts, may at last come to rest and be stead-
fast, that it may be content with itself and, having
attained an understanding of what things are truly
good,—and they are in our possession as soon as we
have this knowledge,—that it may have no need of

MAXIMS

You wish me to close these letters alm, as I
closed my former letters, with certain utterances
taken from the chiefs of our school. But they did

texture of their work is full of strength. There is

mevennesS, you know, when some objects rise con-

le if the whole forest rises to the same height.
Poetry is crammed with utterances of this sort, and
Is history. For this reason 1 would not have you
k that these utterances belong to Epicurus: they
ure common property and are emphatically our οινη.α
