 

EPISTLE XLVIII.

deliberation is necessary in settling than in pro-
pounding a problem! And this is particularly true
η when one thing is advantageous to you and another
ζ to me. Am l speaking again in the guise of an
j Epicurean⁶? But the fact is, the same thing is
‘³ advantageous to me which is advantageous to you;
for I am not your friend unless whatever is at issue

maintained with scrupulous care, which makes us
mingle as men with our fellow-men and holds that
the human race have certain rights in common, is
also of great help in cherishing the more intimate
fellowship which is based on friendship, concerning

word “friend ’¹ is used, and how many meanings the
word “man’' possesse& Lo, Wisdom and Folly are
taking opposite sides. Which shall I join? Which
party would you have me follow? On that side,

“man ”is the equivalent of‘ ‘friend’' ; on the other
sides ‘friend” is not the equivalent of“ man. '' The
·one wants a friend for his own advantage3 the
»other wants to make himself an advantage to his
