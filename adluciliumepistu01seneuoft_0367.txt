⁵more honourable in Scipio to spend his exile at
Liternum⁶ than at Baiae3 his downfall did not

   
   
  
    
  
  
    
   
  
   
     

need a Setting so effeminate. 'I'hose also into whose
hands the rising fortunes of Rome first transferred
the wealth of the state, Gaius Marius, Gnaeus
Pompey, and Caesar, did indeed build villas nean
⁴Baiae3 but they set them on the very tops of the
mountains. This seemed more soldier· like, to look
zdown from a lofty height upon lands spread far and
wide below. Note the situation, position, and type
of building which they chose; you will see that
they were not country· p-laces, —they were camps.
Do you suppose that Cato would ever have dwelt
in a pleasure- palace, that he might count the lewd
women as they sailed past, the many kinds of barges
painted in all sorts of colours, the roses which were
wafted about the lake, or that he might listen to
the nocturnal brawls of serenaders? Would he not
have preferred to remain in the shelter of a trench
thrown up by his own hands to serve for a single
night? Would not anyone who is a man have his
slumbers broken by a war-trumpet rather than by a
chorus of serenaders?

But 1 have been haranguing against Baiae long
enough; although 1 never could harang'ue often
enough against vice. Vice, Lucilius, is what I wish
you to proceed against, without limit and without
end, For it has neither limit nor end. If any vice
urend your beart, cast it away from you3 and if you
cannot be rid of it in any other way, pluck out your
beart also. Above all, drive pleasures from your
sight„ Hate them beyond all other things, for they are
the bandits whom the Egyptians call‘ ‘slovers’ ὅ
