They are immortal, unchangeable‚ inviolable. And
this “ idea,'' or rather, Plato’s conception of it,⁰ is as
follows: “The ‘idea' is the everlasting pattern of
those things which are created by nature.’' Ι shall
explain this definition, in order to set the subject
before you in a clearer light: Suppose that I wish to
make a likeness of you ; 1 possess in your own person
the pattern of this picture, wherefrom my mind
¹<receives a certain outline, which it is to embody in its
own handiwork. That outward appearance, then,
which gives me instruction and guidance, this pattern
sor me to imitate, is the “idea.'’ Such pattems,
therefore, nature possesses in infinite number,—of
ι men, fish, trees, according to whose model everything
¹ that nature has to create is worked out.

, In the fourth place we shall put “ form.” ὖ And
is you would know what “form'' means, you must
pay close attention, calling Plato, and not me, to
account sor the difficulty of the subject. However,
ve cannot make fine distinctions without encounter-
'lug difficulties. A moment ago 1 made use of the
finiat as an illustration. When the artist desired to
’ uce Vergil in colours he would gaze upon Vergil
himself. The “idea’' was Vergil's outward appear-
moe, and this was the pattern of the intended work.
That which the artist draws from this “idea” and
‚has embodied in his own work, is the “ form.” Do
“ ask me where the difference lies? Τὴε former is
κ c pattern ; while the latter is the shape taken from
ιὼς pattern and embodied in the work. Our artist
abllows the one, but the other he creates. A statue has
been-uin external appearance ; this externa! appearance
d the statue is the ‘⁴ form.” And the pattern ⁰ itself
hs a certain externa} appearance, by gazing upon
'luch the sculptor has fashioned his statue3 this
