⁵Fabianus used to give popular talks, but his audience
ssistened with ‘self-control. Occasionally a loud shout
of praise would burst forth, but it was prompted by
the greatness of his subject, and not by the sound of
oratory that slipped forth pleasantly and softly.
There should be a difference between the applause
:of the theatre and the applause of the school; and
there is a certain decency even in bestowing praise.
flf you mark them carefussy, all acts are always sig-
nificant, and you can gange character by even the
most trifling signs. The lecherous man is revealed
by his gait, by a movement of the hand, sometimes
by a single answer, by his touching his head with a
finger,⁰ by the shisting of his eye. The scamp is
shown up by his laugh; the madman by his face
fiand general appearance. These qualities become
known by certain marks ; but you can tell the
‘character of every man when you see how he gives
nand receives praise. The philosopher’s audience,
&from this corner and that, stretch forth admit-ing
hands, and sometimes the adoring crowd almost hang
yover the lecturer’s head. But, if you really under-
letand, that is not praise; it is merely applause.
l'l’bese outcries should be left for the arts which aim
to please the crowd; let philosophy be worshipped
v111 silence. Young men, indeed, must sometimes
'have free play to follow their impulses, but it should
vonly be at times when they act from impulse,
*and when they cannot force themselves to be silent.
{Such praise as that gives a certain kind of encourage-
ment to the hearers themselves, and acts as a spur to
the youthful mind. But let them be roused to the
¹matter, and not to the style; otherwise, eloquence
&a them barm, making them enamoured of itself,
not of the subject.
