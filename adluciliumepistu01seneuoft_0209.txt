But do you yourself‚ as indeed you are doing,
show me that you are stout-hearted; lighten your
baggage for the march. None of our possessions is
essential. Let us return to the law of nature3 sor
then riches are laid up for us. The things which we
actually need are free for all, or else cheap; nature
craves only bread and water. No one is poor accord-

happiness of Jove himself, as Epicurus says. 1 must
insert in this letter one or two more of his sayings : ‘¹
“Do everything as if Epicurus were watching you.”
Tbere is no real doubt that it is good for one to have
appointed a guardian over oneself, and to have some-
one whom you may look up to, someone whom you
may regard as a witness of your thoughts, It is, in-
deed, nobler by far to live as you would live under
the eyes of some good man, always at your side ; but
nevertheless 1 am content if you only act, in what-

of evil. And when you have progressed so far that
you have also respect for yourself, you may send
κ away your attendant; but until then, set as a guard
. over yourself the authority of some man, whether
’ your choice be the great Cato, or Sci pio, or Laelius,—or
any man in whose presence even abandoned wretches
would check their bad impulses. Meantime, you are
engaged in making of yourself the sort of person in
whose company you would not dare to sin. When
is aim has been accomplished and you begin to hold
urself in some esteem, l shall gradually allow you
do what Epicurus, in another passage, suggests t b
The time when you should most of all withdraw into
ourself is when you are forced to be in a crowd.”
