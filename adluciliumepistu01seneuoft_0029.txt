EPISTLE I.

life speeds by. Nothing, Lucilius, is ours, exceth
time. We were entrusted by nature with the owner-
ship of this single thing, so fleeting and slippery
that anyone who will can oust us from possession.
What fools these mortals be! They allow the cheapest
and most useless things, which can easily be replaced,
to be charged in the rec-koning, after they have
acquired them; but they never regard themselves as
in debt when they have received some of that precious
commodity‚—time! And yet time is the one loan
which even a grateful recipient cannot repay.

You may desire to know how I, who preach to you
so freely, am practising. l confess frankly: my
expense account balances, as you would expect from
one who is free-handed but careful. I cannot boast
that 1 waste nothing, but 1 can at least tell you what
1 am wasting,and the cause and manner of the loss;
Ι can give you the reasons why 1 am a poor man.
My situation, however, is the same as that of many
who are reduced to slender means through no fault
of their own: every one forgives them, but no one
comes to their rescue.

What is the state of things, then ? It is this ε I do
not regard a man as poor, if the little which remains
is enough for him. 1 advise you, however,'to keep
what is really yours; and you cannot begin too early.
For, as our ancestors believed, it is too late to spare
when you reach the dregs of the cask.a Of that
which remains at the bottom, the amount is slight,
aud the quality is vile. Farewell.
